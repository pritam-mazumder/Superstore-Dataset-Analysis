## Project Description:

This project leverages various Python libraries to analyze the performance of a global superstore. The insights gained from this analysis will empower stakeholders to make informed decisions in pursuit of their objectives.

## Data Source:

This project’s data is open source, it is the USA Superstore dataset obtained from Kaggle. The data can be accessed via this link. The dataset is in a [CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anuragupadhyay6212/superstore-usadataset) format with 9,426 observations and 24 features.

## Data cleaning and Transformation:

To prepare the data for analysis, several pre-processing steps were performed, including null value removal, data type conversion, and the creation of new columns. These actions ensured that the data was clean and appropriately transformed for subsequent analysis.

## Tools and Technologies:

- Jupyter notebook
- Python
- Library: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
